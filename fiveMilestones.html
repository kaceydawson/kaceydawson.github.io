                        <p>Many practitioners decide to begin their professional careers working for someone else, as an associate, for a variety of reasons:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They want to gain professional working experience.</li>
                            <li>They don't have a desire to own their practice.</li>
                            <li>They want to start earning immediately to pay their expenses.</li>
                            <li>They want to start earning immediately to lower their student loan debt.</li>
                            <li>They want to save money to help fund their own start-up, buy-out, or buy-in.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Many partnerships require the prospective new partner to be an associate for 6-24 months before being allowed to buy in. This is because of the importance of personality in a stable working professional partnership.</p>
                        <p>This “try them before they buy-in” strategy tends to work best when the legal documents are comprehensive, mutually beneficial, and signed before the start of the associateship. Too many associates have started and worked hard with a vague promise of future partnership - only to leave after often feeling used and misled.  </p>
                        <p>In practice partnerships it is important to work out the legal exit before you finish moving through the entrance. We have helped hundreds of professionals navigate the process. Let us help you avoid the pitfalls!</p>

                        <p>Transitioning from associate - or student - to owner is the second practice milestone. Deciding on the ownership model that fits your goals and vision are key:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Start Up –</b> For when you want to create something brand new from the ground up. You get to make the decisions following your unique vision from day one, unencumbered by a history of established processes, staff or policies.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>First steps include assembling your trusted advisory team (i.e. CPAs, consultants). Then you have to:</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Decide on your state</li>
                                        <li>Pick an attorney</li>
                                        <li>Chose a location</li>
                                        <li>Complete your design</li>
                                        <li>Work on your build-out</li>
                                        <li>Engage your IT and marketing solutions</li>
                                    </ul>
                                
                                <li>After this, you have to recruit, interview and hire your staff.</li>
                                <li>Next is outlining your practice and business policies, procedures and processes.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li><b>Purchase/Buy-Out–</b> You can decide to purchase a thriving, well-run practice, or opt for a stable (but slightly dated) practice. This gives you cash flow while you inject new vigor.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>First steps include checking under the financial hood to confirm that its current price matches its relative value.</li>
                                <li>After purchase, you will transition into spending months learning how this established practice has been run, gaining the hands-on practice skills only gained through actual hours worked.</li>
                                <li>As you get up to speed, the next steps will be changing the 15-20% that needs realignment to move your vision for your newly acquired practice to the next level.</li>
                                <li>The largest benefit to this method of practice ownership is instant positive cash flow.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li><b>Partnership/Buy-In</b> - For when the best practice ever… is just too big for you to purchase completely. Or for when you don't want to go it alone and want to operate as part of a group. You opt to buy into a smaller piece of a larger whole. </li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>More so than the other forms of ownership, the “Buy-In” is the most important to understand completely…since, you will not have complete control at the end of the process.</li>
                                <li>With this transition, the personality fit, practice governance, financial incentive alignment, and legal documents are the keys to clarity, transparency, and ultimate long-term success (see Associate). </li>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Owning the real estate where you work is a pillar to building personal and family wealth. Over time, real estate values trend up. As the majority - or sole - tenant in a building, your wealth grows using positive leverage (loans) anchored by the consistency of your practice cash flow. Most professionals use borrowed money to purchase their primary, or secondary, practice buildings.</p>
                        <p>Whether you are planning for ground-up construction, purchase of an existing practice building, or a building “shell” purchase with tenant build-out, we can coach you successfully through the process.

                        <p>Whether you need someone to help you look at the numbers to decide if a purchase is right for you, locate a specialty real estate agent, or negotiate specialty bank financing, we are here to help simplify an otherwise complex process.

                        <p>When they run and manage a single site well, some licensed professionals decide to move to the next level of practice efficiently and profitability. While not strictly necessary, building another practice location (or three, four, or five) speaks to the desire to replicate and expand what you have done well on a larger scale. Many reasons professionals choose to scale include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To provide larger operating efficiencies, such as:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Setting up a call center</li>
                                <li>Bulk-buying</li>
                                <li>Attracting better talent</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>To serve as an offensive/defensive block to competitors</li>
                            <li>To build bigger and sell to a corporate/private equity buyer</li>
                            <li>Just to experience the adventure of expanding</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It usually takes several years to stabilize a new site, so your processes, staff, marketing, and financial controls are key. You will learn that it's not just profit percentage but profit volume at this level.

                        <p>After building a successful practice, there are many reasons licensed professionals decide to sell or merge. Whether to retire, relocate, manage a disability or death, or to cash-out and lower financial risk, there are many reasons owners decide to sell. Selling also does not mean you have to give up practicing. You may choose to become an associate, a minority equity partner, practice part-time or teach (or some combination). </p>
                        <p>Many owners with the know-how to build a successful practice, decide to do it repeatedly ...monetizing their expertise over and over again.</p>
                        <p>A key component in the exit process is working with an experienced team to evaluate your options. Currently, even with higher interest rates in the private equity space, it is still a sellers' market. Understanding sale and purchaser options can result in up to a 100% difference in sale price (yes you read that correctly).  </p>
                        <p>Knowing how to position your practice for sale is important.  An expert team is key. <a href="consulting.html">Work with our Senior Practice Consultants</a></Work> to help you think through the why, when, how, and to whom to sell.</p>

                            <h4>"It was during one of our quarterly meetings that I told Rob I decided to sell my practice. His eyebrows shot up as he said, 'Yeah? Well, what does that look like?' Of course I didn't know, but he did. Over the next hour, we planned an exit strategy. Over the next week, he produced a practice prospectus. And over the next year, he arranged the financing and sale of the practice for top dollar, all without being asked. It's one of the many reasons I work with him. But it's certainly not the only one."</h3>
